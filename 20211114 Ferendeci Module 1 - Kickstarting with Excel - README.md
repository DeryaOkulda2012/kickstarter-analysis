# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise is working on a fundraising project to support her theater company. She is putting together a strategy to figure out how best to use her limited resources to raise money for the theater. Using data available to her and MS Excel’s built-in functionality, she will analyze results of other recent fundraising projects in order to see if her strategy is maximizing the most fundraising dollars possible.


### Purpose

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset available to Louise, she’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Using her knowledge of pivot tables and graphing in MS Excel, Louise visualizes campaign outcomes, whether successful, failed, or canceled, based on the launch dates of their campaigns based on the month of the year they were launched. See chart Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png

Louise analyzed a pivot table with canceled, failed, and successful Kickstarter campaigns by launch dates. She filtered the data to show only the data for theaters (plays).

The data visually shows that campaigns launched during late spring and summer months had more successful outcomes in terms of their positive outcome. The data also shows that the rate of success clearly drops over the summer months to a more “average” level and into the fall months.

The amount of successful campaigns also drops to its lowest level in December as people’s donation dollars have other competing interests, most likely due to the increased spending during the holiday season.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Next, Louise used her MS Excel skills to visualize, analyze and understand the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount for various plays over time. See chart Outcomes_vs_Goals.png

Louise again analyzed a pivot table with successful, failed, and canceled Kickstarter campaigns, this time by outcomes based on campaign goals.

This time, the data visually shows successful outcomes were highest where goal was less than $1,000 dollars but also where goals were between $35,000 and $45,000 dollars. The successful outcomes dropped sharply above $45,000 dollars, and also dropped less so around the $25,000 to $30,000 dollar range.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Very little challenges or difficulties were encountered in the analysis of the data in this particular module. The tasks seemed to be clear cut and straightforward.

Data analysis is usually performed in order to prove or disprove a hypothesis. To be comfortable with such analysis, the more data one has, the better one would feel about the analysis. Therefore, one can never have “enough data”. That said, it is best to analyze the data available from different analytical points-of-view. In this instance, certain goal ranges, or launch date ranges, provide different amounts of data, so more detailed statistical analysis into the quality of data and quantities given may yield results which could be more comforting.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The data shows that campaigns launched during late spring, particularly during May, and summer months, particularly June, had much higher successful outcomes. The data also shows that the rate of this success clearly drops over the summer months to a more “average” level heading into the fall months. This could be due to people’s increasing expenses as the school year begins.

The amount of successful campaigns also drops to its lowest levels in December as people’s donation dollars have other competing interests, most likely due to the increased spending during the holiday season.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The data shows successful outcomes were highest where there was a low-dollar goal, less than $1,000 dollars, and also where goals were between $35,000 and $45,000 dollars. The successful outcomes dropped sharply above $45,000 dollars, and also less so around $25,000 to $30,000 dollars.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset has a lot of theater projects up to the $10,000 range, yet the number of campaign projects above that amount drops significantly, whether successful or failed. Although the number increases just a bit above the $50,000 range, this lack of data in the mid-range could make it difficult to analyze where goals may be much higher for a given campaign, particularly between $10,000 and $50,000 dollars.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

More detailed geographical and country-specific analysis may yield better fidelity of data, as people in different parts of the world may have different spending patterns due to culture, religious holidays, national income levels, etc.

Similar analysis comparing national interests regarding theater (plays) versus musical performances (pop, rock, jazz, etc.), or theater/plays versus theater/musicals may yield additional detail to better plan campaigns.
